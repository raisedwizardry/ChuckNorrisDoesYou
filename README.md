# ChuckNorrisDoesYou

This is a basic website to apply what I am setting out to learn. I am doing this by using a api and consuming it and other things with it.
I want to do this as vanilla as I can. I may start with JQuery and see how intensive it is to use other dependencies in place of.
I chose  the [Chuck Norris api](http://www.icndb.com/api/) to play around with and want to adhere to [these sugestions](https://dev.to/jsguru_io/dos-and-donts-for-javascript-newbies--5dkl).
We will see how this goes.

## Main topics to display

- Event Delegation
- async await
- flexbox
- consuming an api with and without jQuery
- event listeners with dynamic content
- using let instead of var
